# Development-of-Vote-Casting-System

Implemented a secure and time-bound voting system using Python, restricting voting from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM and displaying a message if attempted outside of these hours.
Integrated user registration process where users enter their name and email address to receive a one-time password (OTP) for verification.
Developed functionality to send a random OTP to the user's email with a subject and message, and prompt the user to enter the OTP to verify their identity.
Designed a three-chance system where users are allowed two more attempts if they enter an incorrect OTP, and display an appropriate message if they exceed the number of attempts.
Developed functionality to display the names of the voters and allow the user to choose who they want to vote for, and then display the details of the vote.
Integrated optional functionality where the user can choose to receive voting details via email, and program terminates with a "Thanks For Casting Your Valuable Vote" message otherwise.
